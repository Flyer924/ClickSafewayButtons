# Introduction

This is my [tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (a chrome extension to run custom javascript) script to click all of the Safeway For U buttons (instead of doing it manually or only select ones).

## Installation Instructions

1. Install the [tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) chrome extension
2. Click on the tampermonkey chrome extension and "Create a new script..."
3. Replace all of the code in the new script with the code from "ClickSafewayButtons.js"
4. Make sure the script is enabled under the "Installed Userscripts" tab (called "Click Safeway For U Buttons")

And that's it! All you have to do now is visit the safeway for u page, and it will automatically click all of the buttons.

I've only tested the script on chrome and only with tampermonkey, but theoretically it should work on other browsers and can just be run on it's own.
